# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The QR Code Sharing feature enables users to easily share and discover habits through QR codes. This feature allows users to generate QR codes for their favorite habits or habit collections, and scan QR codes from other users to quickly add new habits to their routine. This aligns with the social discovery aspects outlined in the product vision and provides a seamless way to expand the habit ecosystem.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a BlockHabits user, I want to generate QR codes for my habits, so that I can easily share my successful routines with friends and family.

1. WHEN a user selects a habit from their library THEN the system SHALL provide an option to "Share via QR Code"
2. WHEN a user taps "Share via QR Code" THEN the system SHALL generate a unique QR code containing the habit information
3. WHEN a QR code is generated THEN the system SHALL display it in a full-screen modal with sharing options
4. WHEN a user shares a QR code THEN the system SHALL include the habit name, description, and biome theme in the encoded data
5. IF a habit is part of a custom collection THEN the system SHALL include collection metadata in the QR code

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a BlockHabits user, I want to scan QR codes from other users, so that I can quickly discover and add new habits to my routine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the QR scanner THEN the system SHALL request camera permissions if not already granted
2. WHEN a user scans a valid BlockHabits QR code THEN the system SHALL decode the habit information and display a preview
3. WHEN a habit preview is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the habit name, description, estimated XP, and associated biome
4. WHEN a user confirms adding a scanned habit THEN the system SHALL add it to their habit library with appropriate biome assignment
5. IF a scanned habit conflicts with an existing habit THEN the system SHALL offer options to merge, replace, or create a variant
6. WHEN an invalid or corrupted QR code is scanned THEN the system SHALL display a friendly error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a BlockHabits user, I want to share habit collections via QR codes, so that I can share complete routines like "Morning Mindfulness" or "Fitness Journey" with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or views a habit collection THEN the system SHALL provide an option to "Share Collection via QR Code"
2. WHEN a collection QR code is generated THEN the system SHALL encode all habits in the collection with their relationships
3. WHEN a user scans a collection QR code THEN the system SHALL display a preview showing all included habits
4. WHEN a user adds a scanned collection THEN the system SHALL create the collection and add all constituent habits
5. IF some habits in a scanned collection already exist THEN the system SHALL offer granular control over which habits to add

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a BlockHabits user, I want the QR code feature to work offline, so that I can share and receive habits even without internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user generates a QR code THEN the system SHALL create it using only local data without requiring internet connection
2. WHEN a user scans a QR code THEN the system SHALL decode and process it entirely offline
3. WHEN habits are added via QR code while offline THEN the system SHALL store them locally and sync when connection is restored
4. WHEN the app is offline THEN the system SHALL still allow full QR code generation and scanning functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a BlockHabits user, I want QR codes to maintain the app's visual theme, so that the sharing experience feels consistent with the Minecraft-inspired design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a QR code is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the current biome's color scheme for the QR code styling
2. WHEN a QR code modal is shown THEN the system SHALL include pixel-art borders and themed background consistent with the app design
3. WHEN sharing options are presented THEN the system SHALL use the app's custom fonts and iconography
4. WHEN a habit preview is shown from a scanned QR code THEN the system SHALL display it using the appropriate biome theme and pixel art

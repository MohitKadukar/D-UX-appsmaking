# Fonts Directory

This directory should contain the Minecraft font file:
- `Minecraft.ttf` - The main Minecraft-style font used throughout the app

## Getting the Font

You can download a Minecraft-style font from:
1. Google Fonts (search for "pixel" or "8-bit" fonts)
2. Free font websites like DaFont or FontSquirrel
3. Use any monospace or pixel-style font as an alternative

## Installation

1. Download the font file
2. Rename it to `Minecraft.ttf`
3. Place it in this `assets/fonts/` directory
4. The app will automatically load it on startup

## Alternative

If you don't have the font file, you can temporarily comment out the font loading in `App.tsx` and the app will use the system default font.
